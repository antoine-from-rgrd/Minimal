multi-hued' DSM should be 'chromatic'. 

- Townspeople carry less gold
- Orcs a little less common relative to other monsters
- Both liches and vampires may be a bit too strong

- Troll pits should be removed (perhaps trolls could be in orc pits)
- Rename rattlesnake to Black Mamba (and change color)
Trolls and war trolls are the same brown colour to my eyes/screen..

Ilthillia Dark elf sorceress is the same color as a thief.
Iron golem a bit weak
