Stats have more effect on saving throw
- Rogues gain stealth every second level (rather than every level)
- 50% more SP for mages and priests
- OOD weaker at low CL

Make !speed a bit more rare, !restore more rare, _destruct more rare
- !Resistance about 50% more common
- !Restoration less common on deeper levels
- Add a new shield ego (I'm tentatively thinking 'of protection', providing AC only)
- Remove -StinkingCloud
- No DSM sold in the armor store
- "FA a bit more expensive
- At least one deep artifact should have a Mass ID activation
- Bugfixes: "Wands of confusion sometime, on the first attempt at confusing a (sleeping?) monster, give a positive message (foo looks confused) but the foo is not confused. Later attempts usually work and make the monster confused for several turns. ... 
Scrolls of identify offer to identify some of my inventory that I don't think are needed, like spell books and my (average) lantern... 
Slay Evil ammo exists but it doesn't seem to be able to be generated on mithril arrows/bolts " 
fix description of Elessar activation, perhaps other healing activations 
multi-hued' DSM should be 'chromatic'. 

- Townspeople carry less gold
- Orcs a little less common relative to other monsters
- Both liches and vampires may be a bit too strong
- Balrogs summon too much
- Troll pits should be removed (perhaps trolls could be in orc pits)
- Rename rattlesnake to Black Mamba (and change color)
Trolls and war trolls are the same brown colour to my eyes/screen.. 
so are iron and mercury golems... 
Ilthillia Dark elf sorceress is the same color as a thief.
Iron golem a bit weak

Monsters that heal other monsters
Make some monsters unusually susceptible to confusion/sleep
Prune the list of vaults
- Graveyards are too tough
- Are some monster bolt/balls too damaging?
