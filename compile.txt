Compiling Instructions 
 
(note: in all cases below, the NPPAngband* directory indicates the directory to 
which you 
have chosen to download the source code.)

========================
Windows & lcc-win32 by Robert Ruehlmann (edited for NPPAngband): 
========================

1.	Getting the free lcc-win32 compiler: 
Download the compiler and install it. 
2.	Install the NPPAngband source: 
Unzip and extract the zip-file "NPPAngband Source Code v0.1.0.zip" with your 
favorite archive tool (like WinZip, or untgz.exe).
3.	Create the LCC project: 
Start lcc-win32. Select 'File/New/Project...' from the menu and enter 
"NPPAngband" as the project name. On the "Definition of a new project" set the 
working directory to "C:\NPPAngband*\src" (wherever you extracted the source 
code to) and then select the "Windows executable" option. Press the 'Create' 
button and answer the question about using the wizard to generate the 
application skeleton with "no". We want to use the existing NPPAngband source 
code, so we don't need the skeleton code. 
4.	Adding the NPPAngband source files to the project: 
Add all files from birth.c to load.c to the project, then add the "main-win.c" 
file with the "Add new file..." option and finally the files from melee1.c to z-
virt.c. Select "Add new file..." again, and this time select the "Resources" 
filetype and select the "angband.rc" file. 
5.	Setting various project options: 
Type "winmm.lib" in the 'Additional files to be included in the link' field. In the 'Debugger 
settings' you should change the start directory to "C:\NPPAngband*" (or again 
use your own path to the NPPAngband directory). The 'Executable to start' should 
be "C:\NPPAngband*\NPPangband.exe" (did I already mention change it to your path 
if necessary?). The settings part is now finished. When asked if you want to 
"Open ... files?" simply say no. 
6.	Compiling: 
Select 'Compiler/Generate Makefile' from the menu and wait for it to finish. Now 
select 'Compiler/Make' and NPPAngband should be compiled. 
7.	Run NPPAngband: 
Go back to the NPPAngband* folder and run the NPPAngband.exe. 

All other operating Systems and compilers:

Please see the following site for other compiling instructions:

http://rephial.org/wiki/Compiling

NPPangband should compile with virtually the same instructions as found on this site. 
Please note NPPAngband has a slightly different directory structure and file names.
However NPPAngband is based on the most recent source code.
