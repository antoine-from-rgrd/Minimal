/*
 * Implementation of Extremely Basic Event Model.
 * Limits:
 *   all events are of the concrete type ui_event_type (see ui-event.h),
 *   which are supposed to model simple UI actions:
 *	- < escape >
 *	- keystroke
 *	- mousepress
 *	- select menu element
 *	- move menu cursor
 *	- back to parent (hierarchical menu escape)
 *
 * There are 3 basic event-related classes:
 * The ui_event_type.
 * Concrete event, with at most 32 distinct types.
 *
 * The event_listener observer for key events
 *
 * The event_listener   The registrar for event_listeners.
 * For convenience, the event target is also an event_listener.

/*
 * Primitive event loop.
 *
 *  - target = the event target
 *  - start - optional initial event that allows you to prime the loop without
 *    pushing the event queue.
 *  Returns:
 *    EVT_STOP - the loop was halted.
 *    EVT_AGAIN - start was not handled
 *    The first unhandled event.
