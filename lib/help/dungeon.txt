====== The Dungeon ======

     All levels other than 0 (the town) lie within the dungeon.  Each level
of the dungeon is fifty feet high, and is divided into rectangular regions
(that range from small to several times larger than the screen) 
by impenetrable walls.  Once you leave a
level, you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same depth that you can
explore later.  Monsters move about just as you do, and you may see them again.


--- Terrain ---

Rubble:
     Blocks movement, but is relatively easy to dig through.  Rubble may contain
hidden objects.

Permanent walls:
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.

Staircases and shafts:
     Staircases allow your character to ascend or descend from one level to
another, and are represented by white "<" (up) and ">" (down).  Each level has at
least one up staircase, and two down staircases, unless it is the home of Sauron
(level 99/4950') or Morgoth (level 100/5000'), whom you must kill before
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it.
Watch out for spells and traps that can suddenly force you off the level.  "Shafts"
are represented by light brown "<" (up) and ">" (down) and will take you up or down
two levels instead of one.

Secret doors:
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret
doors always look like granite until found.
     You find secret doors by using the 's'earch command.  Many classes can
also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.

Traps:
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares until found, too often by your being caught by one.
     You find traps by using the 's'earch command.  Many classes can also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.

Monster Traps:
     Certain classes can set traps for the monsters by using the 'O" command. \
     Monster traps can also be modified with the 'O' command as well. These traps
increase in power as the player gains levels.

Runes:
     Runes also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until they cast a spell at you.  Some runes are quite dangerous

Rooms:
     The Pits of Angband contain many kinds of rooms, including some that house
hordes of monsters, contain extraordinary items, or are filled with deadly
traps.  Some special rooms, known as vaults, are extremely dangerous and
lucrative.

Mining:
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out.  Once you can afford it, and if
you can handle the weight, bring a shovel or pick along.  Your ability to tunnel
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus it provides.
Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:  granite is
very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.

--- Advanced Terrain Types ---

     In NPPAngband, Morgoth has made many levels of his dungeon to look like the
outside world.  For instance, there are levels that have lakes, forests, desert,
and many other types of terrain.  Entire dungeon levels can be themed after one
of these terrain types.

In general, when a player or creature is native to a terrain, they can move through
the terrain quicker.  Native creatures also have a combat advantage.  They tend to
be harder to hit, and get hits more frequently when battling non-native creatures.
When players or creatures are in terrain they are not native to, they take longer
to move through the terrain, and most likely will not be as effective in combat.
These advantages and disadvantages tend to be more extreme in deep terrain, or
thicker brush in forests. The player's stealth can be affected by the terrain
they are in.

These terrains can be altered or negated by certain combat effects.  For example,
casting a fireball in a forest can start a forest fire that can hurt or kill monsters
and players, or burn the forest down to the ground.

The player and creatures can take damage when standing on certain terrain types.  A
common sense approach should be taken when entering these terrains.  For example,
all but the most powerful characters will die if they step in lava or any boiling
water, unless they have equipment or magic that makes them native to lava terrains.

In all instances below, creatures who are actively flying do not get the combat and
movement bonuses.

Forest:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to forests.
It can sometimes be burned by fire.  The player can duffer minor damage and cuts
walking through thick underbrush.

Sand:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to sand.
The player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing in sand based terrains.  Sand
based spells and magic are more powerful on sand based terrains.

Water:
     This terrain gives a significant combat and movement advantage to creatures
native to water.  The player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing in
water based terrains.  Cold based attacks can occasionally freeze water.  Fire based
attacks can sometimes evaporate water. Water, cold, ice, boiling water and electric based
spells and magic are more powerful on water based terrains.  Fire, sand, and boiling mud
based attacks are less effective on water based terrains.

Boiling Water:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurer's will die instantly
when standing on boiling water.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to a combination of lava and water.  Lava, fire, water, boiling mud,
and boiling water based attacks are more effective on boiling water based terrains.
Cold based spells and magic are less effective on boiling water based terrains.

Mud:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to mud.
Unless it is boiling mud, the player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing
in mud based terrains.

Boiling Mud:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurer's will die instantly
when standing on boiling mud.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to a combination of lava and mud.  Lava, fire, boiling mud, and
boiling water based attacks are more effective on boiling mud based terrains.  Water
and cold based spells and magic are less effective on boiling mud based terrains.

Ice:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to ice.
It can sometimes be melted by fire.  Ice and cold based spells and magic are more
powerful on ice based squares.  Water based spells and magic are less effective on ice
based terrains.

Oil:
     Includes oil and coal.  Native creatures have a significant combat and movement
advantage when fighting in Oil based terrains.  Most of this terrain type can
easily be set on fire.  Burning oil or coal will instantly kill most lower and
medium level characters and creatures who are standing on that square.

Acid:
     The player can take a significant amount of damage standing in acid based squares.
This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to acid.  Acid
based spells and magic are more powerful on acid based squares.

Lava:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurer's will die instantly
when standing in lava.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to lava.  Lava can sometimes be cooled by powerful cold based spells.
Lava, fire, boiling mud, and boiling water based attacks are more effective on lava based
terrains.  Water, cold, and ice based spells and magic are less effective on lava
based terrains.

Fire:
     The player can take a significant amount of damage standing in fire based squares.
This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to fire.  Fire
based spells and magic are more powerful on fire based square.  Lava, boiling mud
and boiling water based attacks are more effective on fire based terrains.  Cold,
based spells and magic are less effective on fire based terrains.  Fires
can sometimes be extinguished by water or poweful cold based spells.


The player retains all information they have observed about terrain.  To access this
information, go to the knowledge screens (press'~') and go to the terrain knowledge
section.

--- Effects ---
Unique to NPPAngband is an "effects" layer in the dungeon.  In Angband and most
variants, the dungeon has three layers:  One layer for the dungeon floor, one layer
for objects and one for creatures. NPPAngband has a 4th layer called the "effects"
layer.  This is an area of the dungeon in between the floor and the ceiling.  This
dungeon layer can hold many different kinds of things, ranging from harmless fog to
dangerous magic that can damage or kill the player.

Many effects can be dangerous in that they block line of sight, but allow movement
and spell projection.  Magically detecting monsters is now more important than ever.

The basic terrain effect types are as follows:

Lingering cloud:
     The after effects of very powerful magic.  This can be anything from the smoke from
a fireball spell, to posionous clouds that continue to harm the player each turn the
player is standing in the cloud.  This cloud will slowly dissipate after some time.

Permanent cloud:
     This is similar to a lingering cloud, but the cloud will not dissipate over time.

Shimmering cloud:
     Can also be the after effects of very powerful magic.  This cloud can stay dormant,
harmless, and invisible, and then explode every couple turns.  These clouds can also
slowly dissipate over time.

Traps, Runes and Glyphs:
     Starting with NPP 050, all traps, glyphs and runes are now effects.  They can exist
on many different floor types.  In Vanilla Angband and older versions of NPPAngband,
traps could only exist on empty floors.

Glacier:
     A particular effect that allows line of sight, but not movement or spell effects.

The player retains all information they have observed about effects.  To access this
information, go to the knowledge screens (press'~') and go to the terrain knowledge
section.

Inscriptions:
     On dungeon walls you will find inscriptions that will give you hints as to
the type of creatures that exist on the level.  Some inscriptions are dangerous
and may harm the player under certain circumstances.


--- Exploring ---

Light:
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on the items he has equipped, he
may have a light radius of one (a torch), two (a lantern), or more, up to a
rarely-attained maximum of five.  Never risk being without light.
     A torch or lantern burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the 'F'uel command)
with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is rumoured that other
light sources exist which never need replenishing.
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming
is much less dangerous.

Food and Regeneration:
     Never risk being without food.  You must eat every so often in order to
avoid starvation.  The speed at which you consume food depends on your race
(trolls need to eat a lot) and the items you wear.
     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and is also affected by
various object attributes and temporary conditions.

Stealth:
     The higher your stealth, and the further away you are, the less you disturb
the rest of sleeping monsters.

Searching and Detection:
     There are two ways to find hidden areas of the dungeon, doors, traps,
objects, and monsters; manual searching and magic.  At the beginning of the
game, you find everything manually.  If you suspect the existence of secret
doors or traps, press 's' to search the grids around you for one turn.  Later
on, you get access to objects and spells that do this for you, and very handy
they are.

Level Feelings:
     If you have spent enough time on the level, you will get a feeling
about that level.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the more
dangerous and lucrative the level is likely to be.
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters, out of
depth uniques, out of depth objects, certain powerful object kinds, very
special rooms, and chests.

Preserve Mode:
     If you do not have preserve mode on, you will occasionally get the message
"You feel there is something special about this level.", indicating the presence
of a monster pit or nest, a vault, or an artifact.
     However, turning preserve mode off also means that artifacts are created
only once; they will never appear again.  You can check the artifacts that have
been found or lost by using the knowledge '~' menu.


--- The Passage of Time ---

     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn;
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist
that enable you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.

An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:

(very slow creatures can get as little as 1 energy per turn)
     -20 speed:  3 energy
     -15      :  4
     -10      :  5
      -5      :  6
     normal   : 10
      +5      : 15
     +10      : 20
     +15      : 25
     +20      : 30
     +25      : 35
     +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)

Regeneration and recovery:
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints and mana (unless you are
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count
down, rods recharge, and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you
digest some food.  Every hundred thousand game turns equals one day; the town
spends half that time in darkness and the other half in light.
     Every time it takes a turn, every monster aware of you recovers from
temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, they regenerate hitpoints.
