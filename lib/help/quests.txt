QUESTS:
(This file was last edited for NPPAngband 0.5.3)

There are five different styles of quests in NPPAngband. There are two types of
fixed quests and five types of optional quests.

FIXED QUESTS:

NPPAngband has always had two standard fixed quests:

Kill Sauron at 4950 feet.
Kill Morgoth at 5000 feet.

When one of these quests is completed, a staircase appears to allow a player to
go deeper in the dungeon. A player must kill Sauron at 4950 feet in order to be
able to meet Morgoth. Defeating Morgoth, or completing both quests, wins the
game. These quests are unchanged for every game.

FIXED UNIQUE QUESTS:

This is unchanged from Angband. The player always has two fixed quests,
defeat Sauron and Morgoth, in order to win the game. The player cannot dive
deeper than their native depths before completing these quests.

FIXED QUESTS:

While coding support exists in NPPAngband to add additional fixed quests to kill
an assigned number of a given creature at a given depth, there are currently no
fixed quests in the game.  Additional fixed quests could be added by 
altering the quests.txt and limits.txt files.  This would destroy savefile 
compatibility, and would need to be done before starting a new game. 
(Note: Do not attempt this unless you know *exactly* what you are doing.)

OPTIONAL QUESTS:

NPPAngband has a town building called the Adventurer's Guild.
A player may choose to visit this building and receive a quest from the
Guild. Initially, a player can choose only monster quest.  After the player has
gone as deep as level 6 (300') they may choose a quest to clear out a pit or 
nest.  After the player has gone as deep as level 14 (700') they may choose 
a quest to clear an entire level of a particular type of monster.  Occasionally, 
the player has the choice of a vault (artifact) quest. The guild will never 
assign more than one optional quest at any time. Upon completion of an 
optional quest, the guild gives a reward to the player.

At any given time, the status of the player's optional quest can be viewed by
pressing <CTRL-Q>.

The Adventurer's Guild (building # 9 in the town) chooses what kind of quest the
adventurer is given. The guild can assign five different types of quests:

***** <Monster or Unique Quest>
MONSTER QUESTS:
This is the most common quest. The player is assigned to go to a specified
depth, based on the average difficulty of monsters 0-5 levels below the quest 
level, and kill a certain number of monsters (usually around 11 creatures). 
The depth of the quest and number of monsters varies.

Unlike fixed quests, it is not mandatory to complete the quest in order to win
the game.  A player can choose to dive right past the designated quest level, or
leave and return to a quest level. Leaving an optional quest level without
killing the required number of creatures can result in a failed quest.  Failing
a quest greatly tarnishes the player's reputation at the guild.

***** <Guardian Quest>
FIXED MONSTER QUESTS:
Similar to monster quests.  The player is assigned to go to a specified
depth, based on the average difficulty of monsters 4-9 levels below the quest 
level, and kill a certain number of monsters (usually around 15 creatures). 
The depth of the quest and number of monsters varies.

Unlike fixed quests, it is not mandatory to complete the quest in order to win
the game.  Unlike a monster quest, a player cannot dive past the designated quest
level until they complete the quest.  Unlike a regular monster quest, you may
leave and return to the level without killing the required number of creatures,
and you will not fail your quest.  The only ways to fail this quest are to 
die trying and to request to abandon the quest at the adventurer's guild.  A
down staircase will appear when you complete this quest.


UNIQUE QUESTS:
When the player chooses a monster quest, the player can either get assigned a 
monster quest or a unique quest.
Unique quests are similar to guild quests, except the quest is always to kill
one unique. The unique will be from several levels deeper than typical guild
quest monsters. The unique will always appear at the specified quest depth until
killed or the quest fails. Since Uniques tend to be more difficult to kill than
regular creatures, this type of quest tends to be more difficult than monster
quests.

***** <Vault Quest>
VAULT, or ARTIFACT QUESTS:
This quest is to go to a specified depth, retrieve an artifact and return 
it to the guild, which is being held by a monster inside a small vault on a 
small, or "arena", level. The artifact is special in that it cannot be 
weilded by the player. Returning the artifact to the adventurer's guild 
completes the quest. The difficulty of an artifact quest is dependent on 
the monsters guarding the artifact.  You will most likely need some form 
of tunneling, such as a digging tool or a magic source of stone-to-mud, 
to gain access to the vault.   Voluntarily leaving a level with the quest
vault results in immediate quest failure.

***** <Pit or Nest Quest>
PIT, or NEST QUESTS:
This quest is to go to a specified depth and kill or destroy every creature
in a monster pit or nest.  A monster pit/nest has 95 creatures of a given theme.
Since there are so many like creatures bunched so closely together, a creature
from inside one of these special pits/nests will not attempt to summon more 
creatures to the battle.  This type of quest tends to be more difficult 
than a monster or unique quest.  It also increases your player fame
by a greater amount than a regular monster quest, and offers more lucrative 
rewards.  Voluntarily leaving a Pit/Nest quest level results in
immediate quest failure.

***** <Level Quest>
THEMED LEVEL QUESTS:
This quest is a more difficult version of the Monster Pit/Nest quests.  Instead of
95 creatures in a pit or nest, the entire level is full of 200 or more
monsters of a particular theme.
Since there are so many like creatures bunched so closely together, a creature
from inside one of these themed levels will not attempt to summon more 
creatures to the battle.  This tends to be the most difficult type of quest, 
increases your player fame by the greatest amount, and offers the most lucrative 
rewards.  Voluntarily leaving a themed level results in immediate 
quest failure.


REWARD:

The biggest reason to take on an optional quest is the reward.  The quality 
of the reward depends on two factors. The first factor is the difficulty
of the quest.  The second factor is the player's reputation at the guild. 
The player's reputation at the guild is increased by completing quests 
and by killing uniques. When the advanturer fails a quest, their 
reputation at the guild is greatly decreased.

Early in the game, the quest reward is usually gold.  As a player's reputation at
the guild increases, the guild will choose to reward the player with stat gain
potions, dungeon spellbooks, or guaranteed good or guaranteed great equipment.
If a player's reputation at the guild is high enough, the guild may attempt 
to tailor a great item to the player's biggest need, based on an evaluation 
of the equipment the player is wearing, as well as the equipment in the 
player's backpack and home.  The player can also receive permanent increases
to their speed or maximum hit points.  The ultimate reward is for the guild to 
create an artifact specifically as a quest reward.  The player will even be given 
a chance to name the artifact.
