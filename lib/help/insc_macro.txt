====== Inscriptions ======

     You use the '{' and '}' keys to inscribe and uninscribe objects.  The
inscription on an object can have all sorts of effects.

You can also have items automatically inscribed for you by going to the 
squelch and autoinscriptions menu ("=" followed by "s") and set an autoinscriiption
for an object type.  Every object of that certain type the player picks 
up will be automatically inscribed for the player.  Note that an auto-inscription of
an object type also prevents an item from being squelched by the quality sqelching 
feature.  This is useful if the player wants to, for example, squelch all good and
below hafted weapons but doesn't want to quality squelch average maces of disruption.

To designate a main and backup weapon:
     Inscribe both with "@w0".  The 'X' command will replace whatever melee
weapon you are wielding with another so inscribed.  You may also inscribe these
or other weapons with "@w1", etc., and wield weapons 0, 1, 2 and so on as
desired.

To have a given command always use the same spellbook:
     Inscribe it with "@m#", or "@p#", replacing the '#' with whatever digit you
desire.  This allows you to set up macros to cast a spell knowing that it will
never choose the wrong book.  Similar inscriptions make archery very convenient,
and allow you to always use a given magical device with the same keystrokes.

     In general, if you inscribe anything with @<<any command>><<any digit>>,
you can issue the command, type the digit, and use the first legal inscribed
object.

To prevent accidental use of an object with any command:
     Inscribe it with "!x", where 'x' is the letter you type to issue that
command.  If you are very paranoid, inscribe it with "!*"

To automatically pick up an object:
     Inscribe it with "=g".  Especially useful for anything you throw.

Inscriptions for fun and profit:
     Try inscribing the first monster killed by a weapon, hidden object
abilities, and where you found the item or who dropped it.

Automatic inscriptions:
     The game also inscribes objects automatically.  Some of these inscriptions
will disappear when the item is identified, and you may overwrite others.

     "broken"         :  Object is broken in some way.
     "cursed"         :  Object is cursed.
     "empty"          :  Object has no more charges (and you know this).
     "indestructible" :  Object cannot be destroyed.
     "tried"          :  Used an object, didn't learn anything about it.
     "50% off"        :  Object is worth 50% less than normal.

====== Macros and keymaps ======

--- Quick Tutorial ---

     Mages are forever casting spell "a", Magic Missile, in spellbook "a", Magic
for Beginners.  In both keysets, that's "maa", plus "*" to enter targeting mode,
and finally "t" to target.  Wouldn't it be nice if you could do all this with a
single keypress?  You can.
     Choose an unused command (we shall pick "'" by way of example).  Bring up
the macro/keymap screen by typing "@".  Press "8" to create a keymap, and the
game will ask you for a trigger.  Type "'".  You then shift to the action field,
where you input all the commands you want "'" to perform when pressed.  In this
case, you would enter:  "maa*t", and press return.
     Now save your new keymap by typing "6", and either allow the game to choose
your character's name for the preference file, or (if you want all of your
characters to use the same keymap) save to "user.prf".

     This is only the beginning.  What you can do with a spell, you can do with
arrows, Rods of Trap Location, resting, activating stuff, talents, searching;
all sorts of command combinations can profitably be macroed.  Macros and keymaps
are even more flexible when used in combination with object inscriptions.
     In all cases, you remember the exact series of keypresses you need to
issue, pick an unused trigger key, and fill in the action field.


--- Basic information ---

Macros:
     Macros allow you to use a single keypress to activate a series of
keypresses.  They fire off in almost all cases:  when the game is waiting for a
command, is showing a menu, is asking you to enter text, etc.  The only time
they don't activate is when you already have a macro active.
     You may use any key as a macro trigger, but it is recommended that you not
use ordinary letters.  You fill out the action field with the same commands you
normally use.

Keymaps  (sometimes known as "command macros"):
     Keymaps only fire off when the game is waiting for a command.  You may not
use special keys (like F1-F12) as keymap triggers, and must use underlying
commands in the action field (a list of such commands is supplied below).

Effects of one on the other:
     Macros are often affected by keymaps; you may bypass keymaps in macros by
putting a "\" before any action key.  Keymaps are never affected by macros.


--- Examples ---

     Macros are so handy that players (Jim Lyon in particular) have compiled
lists of helpful tricks.

To clear any pending messages:
     Insert some "\e"s (escapes) before and/or after your macros.  Be careful
about skipping past important info!  If you want to be a little more careful,
use "\s"s (spaces) instead.

To learn how to represent any key:
     Some keys cannot be entered simply as numbers or letters.  To figure out
how to include the escape key in an action, for example, you bring up the
macro/keymap screen, type 3: Query a macro, and press escape (ESC) when asked
for a trigger.  This will tell you that an escape is represented by "\e".

Rest as needed:
     Keymap a trigger key to "R*\r".  This is also helpful when waiting for a
monster to approach, because you recover mana and HPs twice as quickly than when
staying in place.

Activate the Phial:
     Macro a trigger key to "Af\s\s".


Other, more complicated macros:
Destroy stacks with out additional input.
\e099k-a\e

In plain language it means: 
\e (esc to clear input buffer and exit other prompts)
0 (choose how many repeats/quantity)
99 (repeats)
k (destroy)
- (floor)
 a(first object if there are many, other wise 'a'im wand), 
\e (esc for exiting the 'a'im wand prompt if needed).


Easy_floor behavior with macros changed in NPP 0.4.0. 

The first object in the floor is always selected if you 
use a macro. Use this macro to destroy objects: 
"\e\e\e\e0\\k-y", the extra "a" is not needed anymore. 

Another useful macro: "\e\e\e\e0\\k-s". 





--- In Depth ---

Not all keys can be entered as simple numbers or letters:
     \e     : escape  (useful for clearing the message line)
     \r     : return
     \n     : newline (is normally treated the same as return)
     \s     : space (' ')
     \\     : backslash  ('\')
     \^     : caret ('^')
     ^X     : control-X  (other control keys use the same system)
     \x80   : character in position 0x80
              (in hex:  decimal equivalent would be 128)

Listing of underlying commands:
     Underlying commands are usually the same as those in the original keyset,
but there are important exceptions:
