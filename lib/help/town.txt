====== The Town ======

     You begin your adventures in the town.  It consists of ten buildings,
each with a shop entranceway, and is well populated.  The first time you are in
town it will be daytime, but the sun rises and sets as time passes.

Townspeople:
     Most townsfolk are fairly harmless.  However, there are slippery-fingered
thieves and armed killers that you need to avoid.  Fights will break out,
though, so be prepared.  Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue,
no experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.


--- Stores ---

     You enter buildings by walking onto their entranceways, which (in text
mode) are represented by numbers from 0 to 9.
     A new display then replaces the old.  You see the name and race of the
store owner, the name of the store, and the maximum number of gold pieces that
the store owner will pay for any one item.  Below it is displayed the inventory;
if it is numerous, you may display another page by typing space.  Near the
bottom of the screen is displayed a list of commonly-used commands.
